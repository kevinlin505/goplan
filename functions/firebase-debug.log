[warn] ⚠  The Cloud Functions emulator requires the module "firebase-admin" to be version >8.0.0 so your version is too old. You can probably fix this by running "npm install firebase-admin@latest" in your functions directory.
[debug] [2019-07-11T23:33:17.544Z] [functions] Your functions could not be parsed due to an issue with your node_modules (see above)
