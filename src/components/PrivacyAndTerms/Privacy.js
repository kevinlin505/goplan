        committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may
        provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
        (&#34;Privacy Policy&#34;) to explain what information may be collected
        on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
        circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This

        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on

      <Title>Website Visitors</Title>
      <Copy>
        Like most website operators, GoPlan collects non-personally-identifying
        information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
        available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
        site, and the date and time of each visitor request. GoPlan&#39;s
        purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to
        better understand how GoPlan&#39;s visitors use its website. From time
        to time, GoPlan may release non-personally-identifying information in
        the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of
        its website.
      </Copy>
      <Copy>
        GoPlan also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
        Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
        leaving comments on https://goplantravelling.com blog posts. GoPlan only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.
      </Copy>
      <Title>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</Title>
      <Copy>
        Certain visitors to GoPlan&#39;s websites choose to interact with GoPlan
        in ways that require GoPlan to gather personally-identifying
        information. The amount and type of information that GoPlan gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
        who sign up for a blog at https://goplantravelling.com to provide a
        username and email address.
      </Copy>
      <Title>Security</Title>
      <Copy>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
