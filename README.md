## GoPlan

#### To Start:

- first time run `$ yarn && yarn start` or `$ npm && npm start` in commnad line. Otherwise just run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the app.
- The app is running on a `webpack-dev-server` on `localhost:3000`
- Currently, the `Keys.js` under the `constants/` directory is missing, you will have to create a `Keys.js` file and paste the `Keys` object containing the `FIREBASE` object in order to connect to the firebase.
